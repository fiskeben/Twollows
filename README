Twollows is a command line tool for checking whether two Twitter users follow each other.

To use Twollows, just download the Ruby script and put it somewhere in your PATH. Call it with the desired Twitter screen names as arguments like this:

twollows.rb ev fiskeben

Twollows will then tell you who follows who.
